# Problem 1

-----------------------------------

$Var(X) = E[X^2]-E[X]^2$

Where $Var(X) = E[(X-\mu)^2]$, so

$E[(X-\mu)^2] = E[X^2]-E[X]^2$

$E[X^2-2X\mu + \mu^2] = E[X^2]-E[X]^2$

$E[X^2] + E[-2X\mu] + E[\mu^2] = E[X^2]-E[X]^2$

Since $\mu$ is a constant, and constants can be pulled out of the expected value function,

$E[X^2] -2\mu E[X] + \mu^2 E[1] = E[X^2] -E[X]^2$

Simplifying, and with the knowledge that $E[X] = \mu$:

$-2\mu^2 + \mu^2 = -\mu^2$

From which we find

$-2\mu^2 = -2\mu^2$

Which we know to be true.
